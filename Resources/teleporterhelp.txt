									ADB Teleporter
									
This module is made to transfer files from your PC to your Android device. 
It first asks for the files to be sent. Please pick only files pertaining to one of the following categories each time:

	Music
	Photos / Videos
	Other
	
The reason being that Teleporter will automatically send them to the appropriate place on your device. For instance, music files will be sent to the Music/ folder on your device, and music players will automatically read them. "Other" files will be sent to your Documents/ folder.

WARNING: Make sure your files DO NOT have any spaces. This will cause Teleporter to exit. Please rename with an underscore(s) instead of the space(s).

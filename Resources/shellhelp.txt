										ADB Shell
										
This module is made to send commands to your device. 

You only need to enter the command itself as "adb shell" or simply "shell" is already pretyped. This allows you to feel more like in a UNIX system (which Android is, anyway).

You can launch it in two different ways:
	- The GUI way, which lets you input a command and then displays the result. It then asks you if you want to enter another command. Rinse and repeat. This method is recommended only to complete command-line beginners that don't want a complete shell. WARNING: there is no auto-completion.
	
	- The CLI way, which starts a shell in your default terminal emulator. This is the recommended method to most users. There are no restrictions. 
		WARNING: type 'exit' to exit the shell.
